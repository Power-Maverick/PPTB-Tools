## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage in ToolBox

1. Build the tool:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. The built files will be in the `dist/` directory:
    - `index.html` - Main entry point
    - `index.js` - Bundled application
    - `index.css` - Compiled styles

3. Install the tool in Power Platform ToolBox through the UI

4. Open Dataverse Trace Analyzer in PPTB:
    - Connects to your active Dataverse environment automatically
    - Loads the latest 100 plugin trace logs
    - Use filter controls to narrow down results
    - Click on any log to view full details
    - Delete logs when no longer needed

## Key Concepts

### Plugin Trace Logs

Plugin Trace Logs (`plugintracelog` entity) are records created by Dataverse when plugin tracing is enabled. They capture:

- Plugin or custom workflow activity execution details
- Performance metrics (execution duration)
- Message block content
- Exception information when errors occur
- Context information (depth, correlation ID, operation type)

### Correlation ID

A unique identifier that links related plugin executions together, helping you trace the full sequence of operations triggered by a single user action. Use it to follow the complete flow of a business process.

### Filtering

The tool provides multiple filter options:

- **Message Name**: Filter by operation (e.g., "Create", "Update", "Delete")
- **Entity Name**: Filter by table/entity (e.g., "account", "contact")
- **Correlation ID**: Find all operations related to a single transaction
- **Exceptions Only**: Show only failed executions with errors

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **PPTB API** for all Dataverse operations
- **@pptb/types** - PPTB type definitions

## Troubleshooting

### No Trace Logs Appearing

**Issue**: Tool loads but no plugin trace logs are displayed

**Solution**:

- Verify plugin tracing is enabled in your Dataverse environment
- Check that you have appropriate permissions to read plugin trace logs
- Try clicking "Refresh" to reload the data
- Check that your connection context is correct

### Filter Not Working

**Issue**: Filters don't seem to reduce the results

**Solution**:

- Ensure filter values match actual data (case-sensitive for some fields)
- Clear filters and try filtering by one criterion at a time
- Use "Refresh" after changing filters
- Verify trace logs exist with the values you're filtering on

### Cannot Delete Logs

**Issue**: Delete button is disabled or operation fails

**Solution**:

- Verify you have appropriate Dataverse permissions
- Check that you have sufficient quota for delete operations
- Try deleting a single log instead of bulk operation
- Review security roles for "Delete" permission on plugintracelog

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Tool is slow loading or displaying logs

**Solution**:

- Use filters to reduce the number of logs displayed
- Clear older logs periodically to reduce query time
- Check your Dataverse environment performance
- Try refreshing the tool

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete old trace logs regularly to maintain performance
2. **Use Filters**: Use message/entity filters to find relevant logs quickly
3. **Correlation ID**: Use correlation IDs to trace related operations
4. **Review Exceptions**: Focus on exception logs to identify errors
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Check execution duration to identify slow plugins
