## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage in ToolBox

1. Build the tool:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. The built files will be in the `dist/` directory:
    - `index.html` - Main entry point
    - `index.js` - Bundled application
    - `index.css` - Compiled styles

3. Install the tool in Power Platform ToolBox through the UI

4. Ensure you have:
    - Primary connection: Source Dataverse environment
    - Secondary connection: Target Dataverse environment

5. Open Data Migrator and follow the step-by-step workflow:
    - Select an entity and configure its migration
    - Add it to the playlist; repeat for each entity and use the arrows to set processing order
    - Save the playlist configuration if you want to reuse it
    - Start the playlist; preview and confirm each entity to continue in order
    - Choose fields to include
    - Apply filters (OData or FetchXML)
    - Select migration operation (Create/Update/Upsert/Delete)
    - Auto-map system entities (optional)
    - Preview data
    - Start migration and monitor progress

## Key Concepts

### Auto-Mapping

The tool automatically maps system entities between source and target environments:

- **Users**: Matched by domain name, email address, or full name
- **Teams**: Matched by name and team type
- **Business Units**: Matched by name

Each mapping includes a confidence level (high, medium, low) based on the matching criteria used. Always review auto-mapping results before starting migration.

### Migration Operations

Choose the operation that fits your scenario:

- **Create**: Insert new records only (fails if record exists)
- **Update**: Update existing records by primary key (requires records to exist)
- **Upsert**: Insert if new, update if exists
- **Delete**: Remove records from target environment by matching primary key

### Lookup Field Handling

Configure how lookup fields are processed during migration:

- **Auto-Map**: Automatically map system entities (users, teams, business units)
- **Skip**: Exclude the lookup field from migration
- **Custom Mapping**: Define custom lookup transformations

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Fluent UI React Components** for modern, accessible UI
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **PPTB API** for all Dataverse operations
- **@pptb/types** - PPTB type definitions

## Configuration

### Migration Playlists

Add each configured entity to the playlist with **Add / Update Entity**. The playlist keeps each entity's field mappings, filter, operations, and batch size; use the up/down buttons to set its processing order. **Start Playlist** asks for confirmation, loads the first entity, and advances to the next one only after you preview and confirm the current migration. The sequence stops if any record fails. Save and load configuration files to reuse the complete playlist. Existing single-entity configuration files can still be loaded.

### Filter Options

- **OData Filters**: Use OData syntax for simple filtering
    - Example: `statecode eq 0 and createdon gt 2024-01-01`
- **FetchXML Queries**: Use complete FetchXML for complex queries
    - Supports advanced filtering, joins, and aggregations

### Batch Settings

- **Batch Size**: Control batch size for optimal performance (default: 50, max: 100 records)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring with statistics (total, successful, failed, skipped)

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails

**Issue**: Migration operation fails with entity or field errors

**Solution**:

- Verify target environment has the same entity/field structure as source
- Check that required fields have values in source data
- Review error messages in the progress panel
- Ensure user has appropriate permissions in both environments

### Lookup Mapping Issues

**Issue**: Lookups are not being mapped correctly between environments

**Solution**:

- Run auto-mapping before starting migration
- Verify users/teams/business units exist in target environment
- Check that entity and field names match between environments
- Verify the primary key values exist in target

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Migration is slow or times out

**Solution**:

- Reduce batch size (try 25-50 records per batch)
- Use filters to migrate fewer records at once
- Check network connectivity and Dataverse performance
- Monitor server-side logs for throttling

### Connection Issues

**Issue**: Cannot connect to secondary environment

**Solution**:

- Verify secondary connection is configured in PPTB
- Check that connection has appropriate Dataverse permissions
- Ensure both source and target environments are accessible
- Verify credentials have not expired

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test with a small data set first
2. **Use Filters**: Use OData/FetchXML filters to migrate specific records
3. **Review Mappings**: Verify auto-mapping results before starting migration
4. **Batch Processing**: Use appropriate batch sizes (50-100 records)
5. **Backup First**: Always backup target environment before migration
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for errors and statistics during migration
7. **Verify Results**: Spot-check migrated records in target environment
